# cas-v14
I recreated my Discord Bot in Discord.js v14 for 2 reasons. #1. I broke the fuck out of the code at some point and all it did was spam an error message in chat everytime it recieved a command. #2. It really was time to update anyways, every guide for anything was horribly out of date, and was meant for newer versions.

While I love what I created it was time to start over, which I did. And holy shit it's better.

Moderation commands are actually locked behind moderation, the token is no longer in the main.js file, and things actually work. No more broken ping command, and it won't crash because I sent too many commands.
