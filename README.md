# cas-v14

## History:

**January 4, 2019** - Project began as a learning experience. 

**April 16, 2021** - Bot was moved across PCs and was remade during that process. Which added features like proper command storage, no more spaghetti code in the main.js file.

**June 21, 2022** - A change was made that broke command interpreting and the bot was briefly abandoned. 

**December 19, 2022** - Bot was remade on discord.js v14 and works better than ever.

## Reason for recreation:

I recreated my Discord Bot in Discord.js v14 for 2 reasons. #1. I broke the fuck out of the code at some point and all it did was spam an error message in chat everytime it recieved a command. #2. It really was time to update anyways, every guide for anything was horribly out of date, and was meant for newer versions.

While I love what I created it was time to start over, which I did. And holy shit it's better.

Moderation commands are actually locked behind moderation, the token is no longer in the main.js file, and things actually work. No more broken ping command, and it won't crash because I sent too many commands.
